David

Sometimes I see a man named **David** sitting at
`Central train station <https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/stops/central-station>`__
and last time we had a chat about `Byron Bay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Bay>`__. Said hello on three
separate occassions. Last time we both greeted and parted with a *fist bump of life*. 🤜🤛
