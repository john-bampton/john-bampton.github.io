``LEGO is a popular line of interlocking plastic building bricks, gears, minifigures, and other parts that allow users to construct a wide range of objects. Produced by The LEGO Group, a privately held Danish company, LEGO toys are designed for disassembly and reuse, fostering creativity by enabling the construction of new models from existing pieces. The name "LEGO" comes from the Danish phrase "leg godt," meaning "play well"``
