Jorge Araica was a Graphic Designer with technical background, an old school pro with some knowledge in the engineering
and programming fields and also a promotor of critical and rational thinking as a way to spread a scientific attitude
towards knowledge. Freedom was his other passion, and he will stand for it at every opportunity he gets.
