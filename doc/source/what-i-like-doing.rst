What I Like Doing
=================

Brisbane Central Business Distinct
----------------------------------

Going into the `Brisbane Central Business Distinct <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_central_business_district>`__
or "City Center" as I call it is one of my all time favorite events.

* I like to hit `Coles Supermarket <https://www.coles.com.au/>`__ on the Corner Of Albert Street And Burnett Lane and
  buy an egg sandwich and a 250ml can of Fanta. Normally I find a place outside near
  `Queen Street Mall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Street_Mall>`__ and sit in the shade for my meal.
* I really like going to `Wake Up Specialty Coffee <https://wakeupcoffee.com.au/>`__ which is in Uptown level one and
  I always buy a small caramel milkshake. The staff their are fantastic. I never get a milkshake if I did the Coles run.
* Occasionally I see **Rodney** a `Big Issue <https://thebigissue.org.au/>`__ vendor and buy some magazines from him. He
  is normally sitting on a busy street corner promoting the magazine. The Big Issue is an Australian non-profit and
  charity that provides opportunity to people experiencing homelessness and disadvantage.
* Seeing my friends **Jonah** and **Rue** at the Brisbane `Dr Martens <https://www.drmartens.com.au>`__ shoe store also
  on Albert Street almost directly across from Coles. There is another young lady that works there that is really
  *sweet* she has helped before and I must get her name next time
* Shopping at `Lowes Menswear <https://www.lowes.com.au/>`__ in Uptown is such a great experience. The two gentleman
  that work there have been a tremendous help and are extremely polite and friendly. Lowes Menswear, also currently
  known as Lowes Manhattan Pty Ltd is a private, family-owned leading Australian menswear and retail chain established
  in 1898 by William Lowe. There are now over 200 stores nationally because of expansion driven by Hans Mueller who
  established Lowes Manhattan Pty Ltd in 1948.
* Sometimes I see a man named **David** sitting at
  `Central train station <https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/stops/central-station>`__
  and last time we had a chat about `Byron Bay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Bay>`__. Said hello on three
  separate occassions. Last time we both greeted and parted with a *fist bump of life*.
* `QBD Books <https://www.qbd.com.au/>`__ in Uptown is full of great products and they always have discounts and
  specials on some products. I have spoken with at least five staff members and at least 4 on multiple occassions. I do
  also visit Dymocks bookstore but I much prefer QBD.
* Visiting the Brisbane Queen Street `Swatch <https://www.swatch.com/en-au/>`__ store and talking to my friend **Tim**
  the *amazing* and *wonderful* Assistant Manager. Tim is extremely knowledgable about watches and fashion and he is
  very helpful. Another staff member **Lachy** works there and seems to know his *Basketball* which impressed me. Lachy
  is also a slick knowledgable sales guy.
* Was given *special treatment* by **Okan** at `2 Brothers Traditional Barber <https://2brothersbarber.com/>`__ in
  Uptown shopping center originally called The Myer Centre. Got both my head and face shaved and all the staff were
  cool. First cut in many years. Located near Lowes menswear on the food court level.

Brisbane Northside
------------------

* Love going to see the manager **Abdullah** at `Sitar Indian Restaurant Albion <https://www.sitar.com.au/>`__. I once
  hosted chess meetups there for Brisbane Social Chess and Abdullah and I had many battles.
