What I Like Doing
=================

Brisbane Central Business Distinct
----------------------------------

Going into the `Brisbane Central Business Distinct <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_central_business_district>`__
or "City Center" as I call it is one of my all time favorite events.

Coles Supermarket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* I like to hit `Coles Supermarket <https://www.coles.com.au/>`__ on the Corner Of Albert Street And Burnett Lane and
  buy an egg sandwich and a 250ml can of Fanta. Normally I find a place outside near
  `Queen Street Mall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Street_Mall>`__ and sit in the shade for my meal.

Wake Up Specialty Coffee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* I really like going to `Wake Up Specialty Coffee <https://wakeupcoffee.com.au/>`__ which is in
  `Uptown <https://www.uptownbrisbane.com.au/>`__ level one and I always buy a small caramel milkshake. The staff there
  are fantastic. **Aydan Marriott** is the manager and I always look forward to seeing him. I never get a milkshake if
  I did the Coles run.

  Address: Uptown Brisbane, Kiosk 1/91 Queen St, Brisbane City QLD 4000

The Big Issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Occasionally I see **Rodney** a `Big Issue <https://thebigissue.org.au/>`__ vendor and buy some magazines from him. He
  is normally sitting on a busy street corner promoting the magazine. ``The Big Issue is an Australian non-profit and
  charity that provides opportunity to people experiencing homelessness and disadvantage.``

Dr Martens
^^^^^^^^^^

* Seeing my friends **Jonah** and **Rue** at the Brisbane `Dr Martens <https://www.drmartens.com.au>`__ shoe store also
  on Albert Street almost directly across from Coles. There is another young lady that works there that is really
  *sweet* she has helped before and I must get her name next time. ``Dr. Martens (also known as Doc Martens) is a
  British footwear and clothing brand known for its iconic, durable, and distinctive air-cushioned boots, distinguished
  by yellow stitching and a welted construction. Originally created by a German doctor and his partner for comfortable
  post-war footwear, the brand found its cultural home in the UK's counterculture movements, eventually becoming a globally
  recognized symbol of self-expression and rebellion.``

  Address: 136 Queen St, Brisbane City QLD 4000

Lowes Menswear
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Shopping at `Lowes Menswear <https://www.lowes.com.au/>`__ in Uptown is such a great experience. The two gentleman
  that work there have been a tremendous help and are extremely polite and friendly. Most often **Stephen** helps me
  find all the best fitting clothes in the store. ``Lowes Menswear, also currently known as Lowes Manhattan Pty Ltd is a
  private, family-owned leading Australian menswear and retail chain established in 1898 by William Lowe. There are now
  over 200 stores nationally because of expansion driven by Hans Mueller who established Lowes Manhattan Pty Ltd in
  1948.``

  Address: Uptown Centre Shopping Centre, Shop 104/91 Queen St, Brisbane City QLD 4000

QBD Books
^^^^^^^^^

* `QBD Books <https://www.qbd.com.au/>`__ in Uptown is full of great products and they always have discounts and
  specials on some products. I have spoken with at least five staff members and at least 4 on multiple occassions. Most
  often I see **Sean** working there and he provides excellent service. I do also visit Dymocks bookstore but I much
  prefer QBD. ``QBD Books (originally Queensland Book Depot) is Australia's largest specialty book retailer, offering a
  wide range of books in-store and online at discounted prices. Founded in Queensland in the late 1800s, the company is
  Australian-owned and operated, with over 80 stores nationwide. They provide a broad selection of genres, new releases,
  classics, and children's books, along with loyalty rewards and author events``

  Address: Shop 115/91 Queen St, Brisbane City QLD 4000

Swatch
^^^^^^

* Visiting the Brisbane Queen Street `Swatch <https://www.swatch.com/en-au/>`__ store and talking to my friend **Tim**
  the *amazing* and *wonderful* Assistant Manager. Tim is extremely knowledgable about watches and fashion and he is
  very helpful. Another staff member **Lachy** works there and seems to know his *Basketball* which impressed me. Lachy
  is also a slick knowledgable sales guy. ``A Swatch watch is a Swiss-made, quartz-powered watch characterized by its
  colorful, artistic designs and affordable, casual, and collectible nature, originally created to revolutionize the
  Swiss watch industry with an innovative, mass-produced plastic design. The brand name "Swatch" is a portmanteau of
  "Swiss" and "watch" or a contraction of "second watch," and the company's success revitalized the Swiss watch
  industry, leading to the formation of The Swatch Group``

2 Brothers Traditional Barber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Was given *special treatment* by **Okan** at `2 Brothers Traditional Barber <https://2brothersbarber.com/>`__ in
  Uptown shopping center originally called The Myer Centre. Got both my head and face shaved and all the staff were
  cool. First cut in many years. Located near Lowes menswear on the food court level.

  Address: Uptown (Level E near Terry White): Shop 45a 91 Queen St, Brisbane City QLD 4000

Brisbane Northside
------------------

* Love going to see the manager **Abdullah** at `Sitar Indian Restaurant Albion <https://www.sitar.com.au/>`__. I once
  hosted chess meetups there for Brisbane Social Chess and Abdullah and I had many battles.

  Address: 331 Sandgate Rd, Albion QLD 4010
