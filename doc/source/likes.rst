What I Like Doing
=================

* Going into the `Brisbane Central Business Distinct <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_central_business_district>`__
  or "City Center" as I call it is one of my all time favorite events. I like to hit `Coles Supermarket <https://www.coles.com.au/>`__
  on the Corner Of Albert Street And Burnett Lane and buy an egg sandwich and a 250ml can of Fanta.
* I really like going to `Wake Up Specialty Coffee <https://wakeupcoffee.com.au/>`__ which is in Uptown level one and
  I always buy a small caramel milkshake. The staff their are fantastic. I never get a milkshake if I did the Coles run.
* Love going to see the manager *Abdullah* at `Sitar Indian Restaurant Albion <https://www.sitar.com.au/>`__. I once hosted
  chess meetups there for Brisbane Social Chess and *Abdullah* and I had many battles.
* Seeing my friends *Jonah* and *Rue* at the Brisbane `Dr Martens <https://www.drmartens.com.au>`__ shoe store also on
  Albert Street almost directly across from Coles.
* Sometimes I see a man named *David* sitting at Central train station and last time we had a chat about Byron Bay. Said
  hello on three separate occassions
* Visiting the Brisbane Queen Street `Swatch <https://www.swatch.com/en-au/>`__ store and talking to my friend *Tim*
  the amazing and wonderful Assistant Manager. *Tim* is extremely knowledgable about watches and fashion and he is very
  helpful. Another staff member *Lachy* works there and seems to know his Basketball which impressed me. *Lachy* is also
  a slick knowledgable sale guy.
* Was given special treatment by *Okan* at `2 Brothers Traditional Barber <https://2brothersbarber.com/>`__ in Uptown
  shopping center originally called The Myer Centre. Got both my head and face shaved and all the staff were cool.
  First cut in many years. Located near Lowes menswear on the food court level.
