What I Like Doing
=================

* Going into the `Brisbane Central Business Distinct <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_central_business_district>`__
  or "City Center" as I call it is one of my all time favorite events. I like to hit `Coles Supermarket <https://www.coles.com.au/>`__ on the Corner Of Albert Street And Burnett Lane and buy an egg sandwich
  and a 250ml can of Fanta.
* Seeing my friends Johan and Rue at the Brisbane `Dr Martens <https://www.drmartens.com.au>`__ shoe store also on
  Albert Street almost directly across from Coles
* Visiting the Brisbane `Swatch <https://www.swatch.com/en-au/>`__ store and talking to my friend Tim the amazing and
  wonderful Assistant Manager. Tim is extremely knowledgable about watches and fashion and he is very helpful
